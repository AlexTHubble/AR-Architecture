# HUBBLE - AR Architecture 

## What is this?
  This is a basic agumented reality architecture that I intend to use across multiple projects. The main purpose is to allow the user to create  AR objects and override their touch, realease, and held functions easily.
  Important to note that this is built on Preview / Beta versions of Unity.
  
## Features
  This includeds two main files, ARInteractableObject.cs and ARSceneManager.cs. The interactable object is inteded to be a parent object with overrides inteded to make creating custom AR objects a breeze. The Scene manager is simply to help originze and manage these AR objects. With easy functions to spawn, select, and delete these objects.
